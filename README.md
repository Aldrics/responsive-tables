HTML/CSS Responsive Tables

This is a small snippet of code based off Bootstrap v3 that is used to create *in-table horizontal scrolling* on mobile devices. It will allow a user to scroll the table horizontally across the screen without breaking the full page layout as often happens with tables.

To add support for more devices if your tables become unwieldy, simply change the **max-width** media query to a more suitable screen size.

Please note that there is a div container around the table and the table tag itself must have the proper class attribute.
